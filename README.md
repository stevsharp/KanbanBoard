KanbanBoard is a simple implementation of a Kanban board, a scheduling system for lean manufacturing 
and just-in-time manufacturing (JIT) that uses visual cues to trigger action. This project provides a digital Kanban board for managing tasks or workflows.

## Features

- Create and manage tasks/cards
- Organize tasks/cards into columns representing different stages of workflow
- Drag-and-drop functionality for easy task management
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- One of the key features of KanbanBoard is its draggable user interface, which allows users to easily manage tasks/cards by dragging and dropping them between different columns representing different stages of workflow.
